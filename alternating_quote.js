But first they must catch you, digger, listener, runner, prince with the swift warning. Be cunning and full of tricks and your people shall never be destroyed.', 'There is nothing that cuts you down to size like coming to some strange and marvelous place where no one even stops to notice that you stare about you.', 'Psychedelics are illegal not because a loving government is concerned that you may jump out of a third story window. Psychedelics are illegal because they dissolve opinion structures and culturally laid down models of behaviour and information processing. They open you up to the possibility that everything you know is wrong.', 'Only psychos and shamans create their own reality', 'The apocalypse is not something which is coming. The apocalypse has arrived in major portions of the planet and itâ€™s only because we live within a bubble of incredible privilege and social insulation that we still have the luxury of anticipating the apocalypse.', 'Turn on, Tune in, Drop out', 'The fact of the matter is that all apparent forms of matter and body are momentary clusters of energy. We are little more than flickers on a multidimensional television screen. This realization directly experienced can be delightful. You suddenly wake up from the delusion of separate form and hook up to the cosmic dance. Consciousness slides along the wave matrices, silently at the speed of light'];
